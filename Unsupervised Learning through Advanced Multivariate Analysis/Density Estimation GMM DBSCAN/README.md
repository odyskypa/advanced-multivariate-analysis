# Density estimation. GMM. DBSCAN

This project focuses on density estimation and clustering using `Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)` and `Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)`. The project aims to explore and compare these clustering techniques on a given dataset to identify the underlying patterns and groupings.

# Project Statement

The primary goal of this project is to implement and compare different clustering techniques, specifically GMM and DBSCAN, to understand their strengths, limitations, and suitability for various types of data. The project involves the following steps:
1. `Data Preprocessing`: Preparing the data for clustering.
2. `Implementation of GMM`: Applying GMMs for clustering and analyzing the results.
3. `Implementation of DBSCAN`: Applying DBSCAN for clustering and analyzing the results.
4. `Comparison and Analysis`: Evaluating the performance of both methods and discussing their effectiveness in different scenarios.

# Proposed Solution

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing the data, and preparing it for the clustering algorithms. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for accurate and efficient clustering.

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Gaussian Mixture Models are used to model the data as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. The steps involved in implementing GMM are:
1. Initialization of parameters.
2. Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model.
3. Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
4. Visualizing the clusters and the uncertainties associated with each data point.

## DBSCAN
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on the density of data points. The steps involved in implementing DBSCAN are:
1. Selection of appropriate parameters (epsilon and minimum samples).
2. Running the DBSCAN algorithm to identify core points, border points, and noise.
3. Visualizing the resulting clusters and noise points.

## Comparison and Analysis
After implementing both GMM and DBSCAN, the results are compared based on various metrics such as cluster quality, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise. The analysis includes visualizations and discussions on the suitability of each method for different types of data.

## Results

The implementation and analysis reveal that:
- GMM is effective in identifying elliptical clusters and provides probabilistic cluster assignments, which can be useful for understanding the uncertainty in the clustering.
- DBSCAN is robust to noise and can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes, making it suitable for datasets with irregular cluster boundaries and varying densities.
